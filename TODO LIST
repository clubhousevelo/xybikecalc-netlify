Incorporate stock configurations


"I've expanded the spreadsheet to range A:O

This supplies stock values when provided for Stem Height, Stem Length, Stem Angle, Spacer Height, and Headset Height.

These values should ONLY be loaded when:
1. A new bike card is started
2. A bike card has been reset
3. The user is changing brand, model, or size in the drop down menu

Important rules:
1. It should not overwrite anything when a profile is loaded and has different values from the spreadsheet.
2. Persistence should continue when refreshing the page as it is currently, so that these spreadsheet values should not overwrite anything when simply refreshing or leaving the page. 

Treat any "0" value in the spreadsheet as 0 and use that value to calculate results, not null. For example, if Headset Height in the spreadsheet says "0", it should say "0" in the input field and be calculated as such.

Also edit the calculators to treat a blank input field as 0, instead of the defaults already coded currently.@calculator.js @position-simulator.js "








in XY Position Calculator, when loading saved profiles, all the Spacer Heights are displaying 20. I know this is not true of all the saved profiles' bike cards. Please make it load the correct Spacer Height.

Does this have something to do with the use of both spacersHeight and spacerHeight? if so, change all the spacersHeight to spacerHeight for consistency
